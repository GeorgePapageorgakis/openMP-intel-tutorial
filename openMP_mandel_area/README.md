### Exercise 5 
**Mandelbrot set area.** 

The supplied program computes the area of a Mandelbrot set. The program has been parallelized with OpenMP, 
but we were lazy and didnâ€™t do it right. Find and fix the errors (the problem is in the data environment).
Once you have a working version, try to optimize the program.

* Try different schedules on the parallel loop.
* Try different mechanisms to support mutual exclusion.
